# CTDext: extended functionalities for the CTD R package
## Using CTDext in R.
### Installation
In R, install the devtools package, and install CTD by install_github(“BRL-BCM/CTDext”).

### Click through the Google Colab Notebook, to reproduce key results from Thistlethwaite et al (2020).
Open /Colab_CTD_PLOSCB.ipynb in Google Colab to reproduce some results from Thistlethwaite et al. (2020) step by step. This does not require CTD local installation. You will:
1. Visualize individual or average cohort metabolomics profiles on comprehensive or individual pathway maps from MetaboLync, curated by Metabolon.
2. Estimate the probability and significance of a metabolite set against different disease-specific network contexts using CTD.
3. Use CTD as feature selection method and a covariate in Partial Least Square (PLS) regression.
